# Signal Decomposition, Sparse-plus-low-rank Splitting, and Compressive Sensing in Julia

The Pluto notebooks writen in Julia are used in the EuroCC on-line workshop (short course)

[AI Techniques: Signal Decomposition, Sparse-plus-low-rank Splitting, and Compressive Sensing in Julia](https://hpc-portal.eu/node/2259).

The notebooks are originally part of the course 

[Modern Applications of Numerical Linear Algebra Methods](https://github.com/ivanslapnicar/GIAN-Applied-NLA-Course).
